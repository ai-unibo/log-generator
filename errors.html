<p>This manual reports some of the errors the user can get using SCIFF.

<h2>CLPFD Integer Overflow</h2>
<p>Example:
<p><samp>! Representation error in user:'t>=u+c'/3<br>
! CLPFD integer overflow<br>
! goal:  't>=u+c'(_2536,_2473,1)
</samp>
<p>This derives from the way SICStus represents domains in CLP(FD).
You can reproduce the error with the following
query at the SICStus prompt:
<p><kbd>?-  X #> Y, Y #> X, X #> 0.
</kbd>
<p>The previous query should logically fail, but in SICStus it first proves that
since X must be at least 1, Y must be at least 2, so X should be at least 3, ...
until you get an integer overflow.

<p>One solution is to ask SICStus to fail in case of CLPFD overflow, instead
of reporting an error. This can be done with the goal
<p><center><kbd>?- fd_flag(overflow,_,fail).</kbd></center>

<p>This can be quite slow; in general it is advisable to 
give a domain to all CLPFD variables.

<p>Another possibility is to use a different <a href="devman.html#solvers">constraint solver</a>.
The <code>r_solver</code> should not suffer from this problem.
<hr>
<h2>SCIFF does not print all answer constraints</h2>
<p>This is due to SICStus; you can force SICStus to show all constraints
with the following goal:
<p><center><kbd>?- assert(clpfd:full_answer).</kbd></center>

<hr>
<h2>Type error</h2>
<pre><samp>! Type error in argument 2 of = /2
! 'a real number' expected, but 10 found
! goal:  _135=10</samp></pre>
<p>This error can occur if the <code>r_solver</code> is used.
See the documentation for the <a href="devman.html#solvers">solvers</a>.
