<a name="howto"></a><h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Load SICStus or SWI, then consult or compile sciff.pl.
For maximum performance, in SWI use
<center><code>set_prolog_flag(optimise,true).</code></center>
and then
<center><code>compile(sciff).</code></center>
In SICStus, use
<center><code>compile(sciff).</code></center>
<p>Create a project, following the indications in <a href="#projects">projects</a>.

<!--
<p>To run SCIFF, you can either use <a href="#projects">projects</a>
(preferred) or use low-level interface, explained in the following.
<p>Create a directory with a name (say 'name') containing the following files:
<ul>
<li>'name_sokb.pl' containing your SOKB (i.e., your program)
<li>'name_ics.txt' containing the integrity constraints
<li>'name_history.txt' containing the history
</ul>
<p>call the goal: 'build(name)'
<p>recompile SCIFF
<p>call either 'run.' or 'run_no_close.' -->

<hr>
<a name="projects"></a><h2>Using Projects</h2>
<p>In order to create a new project:
<ul>
<li>Create a directory with the name of the project
in the path specified in the file defaults.pl 
(it is the father of the directory where is SCIFF, by default).
<br>E.g., suppose the project is myprj, from SCIFF directory:
<code>mkdir ..\myprj</code> (Windows syntax)
<li>Copy the file project.pl in the created directory.
<br>E.g., <code>copy project.pl ..\myprj</code>
<li>Edit the file ..\myprj\project.pl with a text editor
<br>Insert the appropriate names in the facts <code>ics_file/1,
history_file/1, sokb_file/1</code>. 
The facts <code>ics_file/1,
history_file/1, sokb_file/1</code> can contain either the path to a file,
or the URL of the file; in the second case, SCIFF will download the file from
the web. The URL should be given as an atomic term, i.e., with single quotes &rsquo;,
and should begin with &rsquo;http:&rsquo;. E.g., 
<center><code>ics_file(&rsquo;http://lia.deis.unibo.it/Research/sciff/ic.ruleml&rsquo;).</code></center>

You may also add required options
adding facts <code>required_option/2</code> 
(see <a href="#options">options</a>). 
<li>Create in directory ..\myprj the <a href="#history">history</a> file, the sokb file, and the ics file.
</ul>
<p>Now you can build the project, calling the goal
<br><code>project(myprj).</code>
<br>and run it with <code>run(X)</code>, or <code>run_close(X)</code>.

<a name="run"></a><h2>run</h2>
<p>run/1 is the predicate that runs a project.
<p>The argument is currently not bound by default. By default, this predicate
runs SCIFF in a closed derivation (see <a href="#run_closed">run_closed</a>).
The developer of the project can redefine this predicate in the project file
(see <a href="#projects">projects</a>) and use the parameter for input or output.

<a name="run_closed"></a><h2>run_closed</h2>
<p>run_closed/1 runs a project with a closed derivation.
<p>The argument is currently not bound by default.
The developer of the project can redefine this predicate in the project file
(see <a href="#projects">projects</a>) and use the parameter for input or output.

<p>SCIFF can be run either with a closed or with an open derivation.
<ul>
<li>In a closed derivation, after processing the input <a href="#history">history</a>, SCIFF makes a
closed world assumption on the set of happened events. Thus, it assumes that no
more events will happen. This assumption allows SCIFF to detect violation of
E expectations. If another event happens after the closed world assumption, the
derivation fails.
<li>In an open derivation, no such assumption is made. Thus, SCIFF does not
detect violation of E expectations (unless a deadline has passed). More events
can happen without causing a failure.
</ul>
<p>To run SCIFF with an open derivation, use <a href="#run_open">run_open</a>

<a name="run_open"></a><h2>run_open</h2>
<p>run_open/1 runs a project with an open derivation.
<p>The argument is currently not bound by default.
The developer of the project can redefine this predicate in the project file
(see <a href="#projects">projects</a>) and use the parameter for input or output.

<p>SCIFF can be run either with a closed or with an open derivation.
<ul>
<li>In a closed derivation, after processing the input <a href="#history">history</a>, SCIFF makes a
closed world assumption on the set of happened events. Thus, it assumes that no
more events will happen. This assumption allows SCIFF to detect violation of
E expectations. If another event happens after the closed world assumption, the
derivation fails.
<li>In an open derivation, no such assumption is made. Thus, SCIFF does not
detect violation of E expectations (unless a deadline has passed). More events
can happen without causing a failure.
</ul>
<p>To run SCIFF with a closed derivation, use <a href="#run_closed">run_closed</a>

<a name="min_viol_closed"></a><h2>min_viol_closed</h2>
<p>min_viol_closed(Num,CHRList),
<p>amongst the various branches selects the one with the minimal
number of violations. Returns the number of violations and the List of CHR
constraints (containing expectations, etc.) in the best node.
Note that this predicate does not print the CHR store, so the only way to get
the output is to use CHRList (if you invoke min_viol_closed(_,_) you get no
output).
Useful when used in conjunction with the option
<code>violation_causes_failure &rarr; no.</code> 
<p><strong>Known bug</strong>: the number of violations is not precise: often
the reported number of violations should be increased by 1.

<a name="min_viol_open"></a><h2>min_viol_open</h2>
<p>min_viol_open(Num,CHRList),
<p>amongst the various branches selects the one with the minimal
number of violations. Returns the number of violations and the List of CHR
constraints (containing expectations, etc.) in the best node.
Note that this predicate does not print the CHR store, so the only way to get
the output is to use CHRList (if you invoke min_viol_closed(_,_) you get no
output).
Useful when used in conjunction with the option
<code>violation_causes_failure &rarr; no.</code> 
<p><strong>Known bug</strong>: the number of violations is not precise: often
the reported number of violations should be increased by 1.

<a name="project"></a><h3>project/1</h3>
<p>The predicate <code>project(name)</code> builds a project called 'name'.
<p>There must exist a corresponding directory called 'name', as a subdirectory of the
<a href="#default_dir">default_dir</a> and it must contain a file called project.pl
<p>Such file should be created as explained in section <a href="#projects">projects</a>

<a name="default_dir"></a><h3>default_dir</h3>
<p>The default directory where SCIFF looks for projects is declared in the file
<code>defaults.pl</code>
This file contains a fact <code>default_dir</code> that contains the path
of the directory containing projects. By defult, it is the father of the
directory containing SCIFF; i.e., by default defaults.pl
contains <code>default_dir('../').</code>

<hr>


<a name="options"></a><h2>Options</h2>
<p>The following options are recognised by the SCIFF proof-procedure:
<ul>
<li><a href="#fulfiller">fulfiller</a>
<li><a href="#seq_act">seq_act</a>
<li><a href="#factoring">factoring</a>
<li><a href="#sciff_debug">sciff_debug</a>

<li><a href="#min_viol_closed">min_viol_closed</a>
<li><a href="#min_viol_open">min_viol_open</a>
<li><a href="#coloring">coloring</a>
</ul>
<p>Options can be stated in <a href="#projects">projects</a> by adding to the file project.pl a
fact <code>required_option/2</code>. For example, if your project requires
the option <code>seq_act</code>, add to the corresponding project.pl the fact:
<center><code>required_option(seq_act,on).</code></center>  
<p>To set an option, use <a href="#set_option">set_option</a>
<p>To read the state of an option, use <a href="#get_option">get_option</a> or 
<a href="#show_options">show_options</a>.
<p>
<hr>

<a name="fulfiller"></a><h3>fulfiller</h3>
<p>The fulfiller option enables the generative version of SCIFF (called g-SCIFF,
see [Alberti et al.
<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/b6418542t7749648/?p=305c947d387c49c6b6d4bb20457316de&pi=6">Security protocols verification in abductive logic programming: a case study</a>,
ESAW 2005]).
Operationally, after <code>close_history</code>, for each positive expectation
that is still pending <code>e(X,T)</code> the corresponding atom  <code>h(X,T)</code>
is abduced, fulfilling the expectation.

<a name="seq_act"></a><h3>seq_act</h3>
<p>seq_act option imposes that two events cannot happen at the same time.</p>
<p>If seq_act is on, two events cannot happen at the same time.</p>
<p>If seq_act is off, more events can happen at the same time.</p>
<p>This option is primarily used in the Abductive Event Calculus.</p>
<p>Usually is off.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> this option is not necessary (from a declarative viewpoint),
because you can easily add an integrity constraint stating that two events
should not happen at the same time.
The option is provided here because it has a possibly more efficient
behaviour with the CLP(FD) solver. However, it does nothing when using the
CLP(R) solver. 

<a name="factoring"></a><h3>factoring</h3>
<p>The factoring option enables or disables the factoring transition.
The factoring transition tries and unifies two abduced atoms. On backtracking,
the two abducibles are dis-unified.
The factoring transition is useful for obtaining minimal answers.
It is important for the Abductive Event Calculus.
<p>The factoring option is off by default.

<a name="sciff_debug"></a><h3>sciff_debug</h3>
<p>Print on screen debug messages.</p>
<p>Usually is off.</p>

<a name="violation_causes_failure"></a><h3>violation_causes_failure</h3>
<p>The option violation_causes_failure Decides if a violation of the protocol should induce a failure 
(and backtracking where possible) of the proof.
Allowed values are yes/no.
Default value is yes.</p>
	
<a name="graphviz"></a><h3>graphviz</h3>
<p>Represents the SCIFF derivation tree in form of a graph, using the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> software.
<p>The file should be opened with <code>init_graph(FileName,Stream)</code>, 
and, after the execution of the proof, it should be closed with <code>close_graph</code>.
The produced file can be opened with <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">DOT</a> and converted in PostScript or other formats.
<p>Default value is off.</p>

<a name="allow_events_not_expected"></a><h3>allow_events_not_expected</h3>
<p>By default, SCIFF allows events to happen even if they are not expected.
By setting the <code>allow_events_not_expected</code> option to <code>no</code>, SCIFF detects as violation if an
happened event does not have a corresponding expectation.
<p>Useful, in particular, to prove Strong Conformance in the <a href="#allows">allows</a>
framework.
<p>Default value is <i>yes</i>.

<a name="coloring"></a><h3>coloring</h3>
<p>When this option is <code>on</code>, the output of SCIFF uses colors and text styles 
(underlined, bold, ...) to improve readability.
In particular, the special SCIFF atoms are colored (E, H, EN, ...).
<p>In SWI, variables are also colored; Universal variables are Magenta, while existential are blue;
flagged variables are underlined.
<p>Coloring uses the ANSI codes, so it is available only on those systems that use ANSI codes.
It works correctly in Linux and in MacOS, while it does not work in Windows XP.
For this reason, by default coloring is enabled in Unix and MacOS, while it is disabled in Windows.
However, it can be enabled or disabled with <a href="#set_option">set_option</a>.

<a name="portray_ic"></a><h3>portray_ic</h3>
The output of SCIFF includes the implications that remain at the end of the derivation.
Some of these implications are the original Integrity Constraints (IC),
others are partially solved integrity constraints (PSIC).
The integrity constraints have an internal representation as atoms ic(Body,Head),
and they will be shown as such whenever the <code>portray_ic</code> option is <code>off</code>.
When the <code>portray_ic</code> is <code>on</code>, the IC are shown with
the same syntax of <a href="#ics">ics</a>.
In the same way, PSIC are shown with their internal representation when
<code>portray_ic</code> is <code>off</code>, and with the syntax of IC when it is <code>on</code>.
If option <a href="#coloring">coloring</a> is on, IC are represented with a red implication symbol,
while in PSIC the implication symbol is cyan.
<p>By default, <code>portray_ic</code> is <code>on</code>.

<a name="set_option"></a><h3>set_option(Option,Value)</h3>
<p>Each option can be set using the predicate:</p>
<p>set_option(Option,Value)</p>
<p>where Option is the name of the option you want to modify,
and Value is the new value you want to assign to it.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#get_option">get_option</a></p>

<a name="get_option"></a><h3>get_option(Option,State)</h3>
<p>You can inspect the state of an option using the predicate:
sciff_option(?Option, ?State).</p>
<p>See also <a href="#set_option">set_option</a></p>

<a name="show_options"></a><h3>show_options</h3>
<p>The predicate show_options shows all the <a href="#options">options</a> available and their state</p>
<p>See also <a href="#get_option">get_option</a>, <a href="#set_option">set_option</a></p>


<hr>
<a name="history"></a><h2>Syntax of the history</h2>
<p>The history is a file containing Prolog facts, given with one of the following syntaxes:
<ul>
<li>either as <code>hap/2</code> facts (the first argument being a term, the second is the time,
i.e., an integer number)
<li>or as <a href="#apache">Apache</a> Combined Log Format
<li>or as follows.
</ul>

In the last syntax, events are terms with a Functor and the following arguments:
<ul>
<li>A list containing a constant
<li>Dialog Identifier (constant)
<li>Sender (constant)
<li>Receiver (constant)
<li>Performative (constant)
<li>Arguments of the performative (List of Terms)
<li>Time (integer)
</ul>
<p>The term should be terminated with full stop.
<p>It will be converted into an atom
<p><center><strong>H</strong>(Functor(Sender,Receiver,Performative(Arguments),DialogID),Time).</center>

<a name="apache"></a><h3>Apache Combined Log Format</h3>
<p>SCIFF is able to parse the access_log file of the Apache web server.
The intended use is to verify if the access policies are respected.
The recognized format is the
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/logs.html#combined">Combined Log Format</a>.

<p>In order to read the history from the access log, the file should be loaded in
the project file, with the usual history_file declaration. SCIFF recognizes that the
history is an access log from the <i>name of the file</i> in the file declaration.
If the filename terminates with <code>access_log</code>, then the parser of
the access log is activated. E.g., the project file could have a fact:

<center><code>history_file(monday.access_log).</code></center>

<p>The <b>H</b> events that SCIFF receives have the following format:

<center><b>H</b>(log(IP,Ident,UserID,ReadableTime,Request,Status,Size,Referer,Browser),T)</center>

<p>where
<ul>
<li><b>IP</b>: the IP address of the requesting machine. It is a 32-bit integer number (e.g., 3232235770, not 192.168.0.250)
<li><b>Ident</b>: the identity of the client (highly unreliable, as stated in Apache documentation)
<li><b>UserID</b>: User ID. Currently not implemented
<li><b>ReadableTime</b>: Time in human-readable format: a term <code>time(Day/Month/Year,Hour/Min/Sec,TimeZone)</code>  
<li><b>Request</b>: The request to the server. It is a term get/1 or put/1, containing a list of atomic constants. E.g.,
"GET /Info1/dummy.gif HTTP/1.1" is provided as <code>get(['Info1',dummy,gif])</code>. 
The protocol version is currently discarded
<li><b>Status</b>: the status code that the server sends back to the client (integer)
<li><b>Size</b>: size of the object returned to the client
<li><b>Referer</b>: a list of atomic constants. E.g.: http://linuxsrv.lab2007.ing.man/Info1/consegna.php?Action=upload
is provided as [http,linuxsrv,lab2007,ing,man,'Info1',consegna,php,'Action',upload].
<li><b>Browser</b>: the identifying information that the client browser reports about itself.
It is provided as a code-list in SICStus syntax (i.e., an unparsed string).
<li><b>T</b> is the time, in integer format
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="ics"></a><h2>Syntax of ICs</h2>
<p>The ICs are the Integrity Constraints of the SCIFF proof-procedure.
They are written in one (or more) text files that should be declared
in the file project.pl (see <a href="projects">projects</a>) with a fact <code>ics_file(Filename).</code> 
<p>ICs are in the form of implications:
<center><code>Body ---> Head</code></center> 
where Body is a conjunction of
<ul>
<li>literals H (happened events) and their negation !H
<li>expectations E (expected to happen), EN (expected not to happen) and
their default negation !E and !EN
<li>abducibles ABD
<li><a href="#clp">clp</a> constraints
<li>atoms defined in the SOKB.
</ul>
<!--<p>Currently, the first literal in the Body must be of type H, E, EN, or ABD.-->
<p>Head is a disjunction of conjunctions. Disjunctions are represented wih the 
symbol <code>\/</code> , and conjunctions with <code>/\</code> .
<p>Each conjunct can be
<ul>
<li>an expectation E (expected to happen), EN (expected not to happen) or
their default negation !E and !EN
<li>an abducible ABD
<li>a <a href="#clp">clp</a> constraint
<li>a literal defined in the SOKB.
</ul>
<p>For example, the following is a valid IC:
<code><pre>
    % happened events
    H(tell(A,B,openauction(Item,TEnd,TDeadline),AuctionId),TOpen)
    /\ H(tell(B,A,bid(Item,Quote),AuctionId),TBid)
	/\ deadline(X) % Literal defined in SOKB
	/\ TOpen < TBid % CLP constraints
	/\ TOpen <= TEnd
	/\ TEnd < TDeadline+X
--->
	E(tell(A,B,answer(win,Item,Quote),AuctionId),TWin)
	/\ TWin <= TDeadline
	/\ TEnd < TWin
\/
	E(tell(A,B,answer(lose,Item,Quote),AuctionId),TLose)
	/\ TLose <= TDeadline
	/\ TEnd < TLose.
</pre></code>
<p>Comments are represented with the ampersand symbol (%) and terminate
at the end of the line (as in Prolog). The IC terminates with a full stop.

<p>As an alternative, ICs can also be defined in <a href="#ruleml">ruleml</a>.

<a name="ruleml"></a><h3>RuleML</h3>
<p>As an alternative to the syntax of <a href="#ics">ics</a>, it is possible to
define the ICs with the syntax in RuleML 0.9.
<p>RuleML files are declared in the project file with the same syntax of normal
ICs files: using the <code>ics_file/1</code> predicate. 
The user should load the <code>ruleml_parser</code> library before loading the <code>project</code>, i.e.:

<code><pre>?- use_module(library(ruleml_parser)).
?-project(...).
</pre></code>
 
<p>SCIFF will try to parse
the file first as a RuleML file. In case of failure, it will use the normal
ICs parser.

<hr>
<a name="sokb"></a><h2>Syntax of SOKB</h2>
<p>The SOKB is a set of clauses, a la logic programming. Each clause is
an implication
<center><code>head :- body.</code></center>
where <code>head</code> is an atom and <code>body</code> is a conjunction
of literals, that can contain abducibles and <a href="#clp">clp</a> constraints.

<p>The abducibles can be expectations or general abducibles.
The syntax of abducibles is different from that of <a href="#ics">ics</a>, and
is the following:

<ul>
<li><code>e(Event,Time)</code> is a positive expectation
<li><code>note(Event,Time)</code> is a negated positive expectation (i.e., the default
negation of a positive expectation)
<li><code>en(Event,Time)</code> is a negative expectation
<li><code>noten(Event,Time)</code> is a negated negative expectation (the default
negation of en)
<li><code>abd(Term,Time)</code> is a general abductive atom
</ul>

<p>The funcor symbols <code>e, note, en, noten, abd</code> and <code>h</code>
are reserved: if you define a predicate <code>e/4</code> you will not be able to
use it in the ICs.

<p>The SOKB can be defined in one or more files.
Each sokb file should be declared in the <code>project.pl</code> in a fact
<center>sokb_file(Name_Of_SOKB_File).</center>

<p>Exactly one of the SOKB files should define the predicate <code>society_goal/0</code>.
The predicate <code>society_goal</code> contains the goal of the society,
that is the starting point of SCIFF derivation.
<code>society_goal</code>
is invoked by the <a href="#run">run</a>, <a href="#run_open">run_open</a> and
<a href="#run_closed">run_closed</a> 
predicates that start the derivation.

<hr>
<a name="clp"></a><h2>CLP Constraints</h2>
<p>Currently, the set of CLP constraints that are interpreted in the
<a href="#ics">ics</a> is the following:
<ul> 
<li> == (equality)
<li> &lt;&gt; (disequality)
<li> &gt;= (greater than or equal to)
<li> &gt; (greater than)
<li> =&lt; (less than or equal to)
<li> &lt; (less than)
<li> &lt;&gt; (different from)
<li>:: (membership; the second argument should be a ground list)
</ul>
<p>as well as unification = and dis-unification !=. 
&lt;&gt; and != have the same declarative semantics; however &lt;&gt; is
intended as disequal amongst integers, while != is better suited for disunification
between terms. 

<hr>
<a name="fdet"></a><h2>fdet declarations</h2>
<p>In order to test if an <strong>E</strong> expectation is fulfilled by a
<strong>H</strong> event, SCIFF generates two alternative hypotheses:
in one it tries to prove that the two will unify, while in the second it tries
and prove that they will not unify.
<p>In some cases, the protocol specification might implicitly impose that
all expectations of type <center><strong>E</strong>(message(S,R,type),T)</center> can be fulfilled at most by <i>one</i> event. 
For instance, if in a protocol we have that
<center><strong>E</strong>(message(S1,R1,type),T1) &and; <strong>E</strong>(message(S2,R2,type),T2) &rarr; S1=S2 &and; R1=R2 &and; T1=T2</center> 
then we know that only one event can fulfill an <strong>E</strong> expectation matching with
<center><strong>E</strong>(message(S,R,type),T).</center>
<p>In such cases, the performance can be improved by declaring such event as
having <i>deterministic fulfilment</i>. 
This can be accomplished by adding to the SOKB a predicate <code>fdet/1</code>.
In the example, add to the SOKB the definition:
<br><code>fdet(e(message(S,R,type),T)).</code> 
<p>Of course, if one <strong>E</strong> expectation can be matched by
more than one <b>H</b> event, declaring it as <code>fdet</code> undermines <i>completeness</i>,
i.e., some solutions may be lost. 
<hr>
<a name="allows"></a><h2>AlLoWS</h2>

<p>A<sup>l</sup>LoWS (Abductive Logic Web-service Specification)
is a framework for testing conformance of web services to choreographies
(see publication PPDP 2006).
<p>In order to use A<sup>l</sup>LoWS, you have to
<ul>
<li>Define the interface behaviour of the web service under test. This is done by
defining SOKB and <a href="#ics">ics</a>. 
The name of the web service under test must be declared in the SOKB in a
fact <code>testing/1</code>. E.g., add to the SOKB <code>testing(ws).</code>
<li>Define the choreography, again by defining a SOKB and <a href="#ics">ics</a>
</ul>
<p>In A<sup>l</sup>LoWS, expectations are only positive (<strong>E</strong>)
and have the following syntax:
<center><strong>E</strong>(do(Expecter,Sender,Receiver,Message,DialogID),Time)</center>
<p>where Expecter can be either <code>chor</code> (i.e., this is an expectation of the
choreography), or the name of the web service under test (in the example, <code>ws</code>)
<p>The <code>society_goal</code> should be defined only once (in either of the 
two SOKBs), and should contain the expectation, both from the choreography
and from the web service's viewpoint, of the message that initiates 
the interaction. For example:
<p><code>society_goal:-<br>
&nbsp;e(do(ws,  peer,ws,m1,d1),1),<br>
&nbsp;e(do(chor,peer,ws,m1,d1),1).</code>
<p>Build the project, with the predicate <a href="#project">project</a>
<p>Finally, you can execute the goal <code>allows(Succeed)</code>, or redefine, in the
file <code>project.pl</code> (see <a href="#projects">projects</a>) the
predicate <a href="#run">run</a> as follows:
<center><code>run(Succeed) :- allows(Succeed).</code></center>
<p>If the web service is not conformant, A<sup>l</sup>LoWS provides, 
as counterexample, a possible
history that does not satisfy either the web service's or the choreography's
specifications.
<p>The parameter <i>Succeed</i> is useful to drive the behaviour of the predicate 
<code>allows/1</code>.
<ul>
<li>If Succeed=false, predicate <code>allows/1</code> will fail in case
the web service is not conformant
<li>if Succeed=true, predicate <code>allows/1</code> will succeed
in all cases, useful to inspect the constraint store and have more information
about the history that proves non compliance
<li>if Succeed = verbose, <code>allows/1</code> prints all the possible histories.
</ul>  
<p>A<sup>l</sup>LoWS can prove two types of conformance, named <i>Feeble</i> and
<i>Strong</i> conformance (see publication PPDP 2006). The two types of proof
are distinguished by means of the option (see <a href="#options">options</a>) 
<a href="#allow_events_not_expected">allow_events_not_expected</a> 
<ul>
<li><a href="#allow_events_not_expected">allow_events_not_expected</a> = yes
(default) &rarr; Feeble conformance
<li><a href="#allow_events_not_expected">allow_events_not_expected</a> = no
&rarr; Strong conformance.
</ul>

<a name="pretty_print"></a><h2>pretty_print</h2>
<p>The module pretty_print is not loaded by default. 
If it is, it makes the output of SCIFF more readable.
It is not loaded by default because some external programs capture the output
of SCIFF, so we recommend using it only if you run SCIFF as a stand-alone
procedure (not with SOCS-SI or SCIFF Editor).
To use pretty_print, simply consult it with<br>
<center><code>[pretty_print].</code></center><br>
and the output of SCIFF will be more readable.

<hr>
<a name="svg"></a><h2>svg</h2>
<p>The output of SCIFF can be saved in SVG format, readable with modern
browsers, such as Opera or Firefox, or with the Adobe plugin for other browsers.
<p>To use SVG output, invoke the goal<br>
<center><code>run_predicate, svg(OutFile,Anim,Options)</code></center><br>
where run_predicate is one of <a href="#run">run</a>, <a href="#run_open">run_open</a> 
or <a href="#run_close">run_close</a>.
<ul>
<li>OutFile is the name of the output file, e.g., 'result.svg'
<li>Anim can be either 'no' or 'anim(Sec)'. Two different types of graphs are
visualised. In the second, there is an animation lasting Sec seconds. Note that
currently Firefox does not support SVG animations, Opera does.
<li>Options is a list that can contain zero or more of the following constants:
<ul>
<li>grid: visualise a grid
<li>history: visualise the history
<li>exp: visualise expectations (only E expectations currently shown)
</ul>
</ul>

<a name="help"></a><h2>help</h2>
<p>To get help, type help(topic) at the SICStus prompt.
The available topics (links) are represented between stars,
as in the following example:
<p><a href="#options">options</a>
<p>Note that topics names are case-sensitive.

<p>To access the developer's manual, type either <code>devman.</code> or <code>devman(topics).</code> at the SCIFF prompt,
or read <a href="devman.html">devman.html</a> from the documentation.
